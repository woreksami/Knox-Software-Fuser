[Fuser]

; ── Mode ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; sender   = Second PC (runs DXGI capture, transmits over UDP)
; receiver = Main gaming PC (receives, renders transparent overlay)
Mode           = receiver

; ── Network ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
; LocalIP:  The IP address of the NIC you want to bind to.
;           For Thunderbolt/USB4 direct-attach links this is
;           typically the auto-assigned 169.254.x.x address,
;           or a static IP you configured (e.g. 192.168.50.2).
;           Use 0.0.0.0 to let the OS choose.
;
;           Run KnoxFuser.exe once to see a list of adapters
;           and their IPs printed to the console.
;
LocalIP        = 0.0.0.0

; RemoteIP: (Sender only) IP address of the RECEIVER machine.
;           On a direct Thunderbolt/Ethernet cable this is the
;           other end of the link, e.g. 192.168.50.1
RemoteIP       = 192.168.50.2

; Port:     UDP port used for both sender and receiver.
;           Must match on both machines.
Port           = 9877

; AdapterIndex: (reserved, not currently used in binding logic)
;           Set to -1 for auto.  If you want to force a specific
;           adapter, set LocalIP to its IP address instead.
AdapterIndex   = -1

; ── Capture ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
; CaptureMonitor: (Sender only) Zero-based index of the monitor
;           to duplicate via DXGI Desktop Duplication.
;           0 = primary monitor, 1 = second monitor, etc.
CaptureMonitor = 0
